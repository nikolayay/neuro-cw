- p1q2

reqs:

- all plots have clear x, and y labels, along with units

plots:

-

## Part A. Integrate-and-fire neurons

### Question 1. Simulating integrate-and-fire model

plot:

- voltage as a function of time

notes:

- once membrane potential exceeds threshold, simply set the membrane potential to Vrest

### Question 2. Two interconnected neurons

Simulating two cases:
a) assuming that the synapses are excitatory with Es = 0 mV

b) assuming that the synapses are inhibitory with Es = âˆ’80 mV.

plot:

- plot voltage as function fo time

* both cases on same graph in different colours

notes:

- simple synapse model in lectures

- comment on each case
